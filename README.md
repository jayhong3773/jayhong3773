## Hello, I'm Jay!

- ðŸ”­ I'm a graduate from civil engineering who wants to transition to data analytics.
  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analytics through bootcamp and working on several analytics projects <a href="https://glorious-bill-6a1.notion.site/Jaewon-Jay-Hong-26f75e1d111580b0a567ed574632426d?source=copy_link">[Notion]</a>
  
- ðŸ‘¯ I discovered the value of data while working on a startup project â€” you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/jayhong3773/Share.io">[here]</a>
  
- âš¡ I love the moment of finding meaningful insights after spending serval days collaborating with people.
